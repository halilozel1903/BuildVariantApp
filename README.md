Build variant is a feature of Android Studio to create a project which can be build in different versions.

By using Build Variants, you can create different versions of apk by only using single codebase.

It can create different apks for Huawei and Google implementations.

Gradle automatically creates all the possible combination of the variants in different dimensions that you created.
